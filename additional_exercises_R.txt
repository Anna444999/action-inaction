Exercises R Paper replication:

1. Adjust the code so that every output is saved automatically. Make sure that your code completes the following:
- Global path that can easily be adjusted
- Folder (make separate folders for tables and graphs)
- File name
- Defined size/format
- Extra: Sometimes to get an overview of all the graphs it is helpful if they are all saved in one pdf as well.

2. The code is repetitive when producing graphs. 
Can you think of a better way to write this so that if something needs to be adjusted in all graphs, it can be done with one adjustment? 
By adjusting the code, it should also be easier to add another outcome variable, if desired. 

3. Setup renv to track the packages used in the replication. 

4. The commenting of the markdown file is rather sparse. 
Consider what could be improved and why it is important. 
For instance, comments should include the purpose of the choice of coding and not simply what the code does. 

5. The data contains a considerable fraction of NA values. Check whether you understand how these are handled in the code. 
What could be adjusted and how would this affect the output?
